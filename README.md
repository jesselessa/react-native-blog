# react-native-blog

A blog created with React Native and Expo tools, fetching data from JSONPlaceholder API

## Prerequisites

First, install Expo, an open-source framework for apps that runs natively on Android, iOS and the web, on your device.

To use Expo, you also need to have the following tools installed on your machine :

- Node.js v20.10.0 LTS ;
- Git, for source control ;
- Watchman (for Linux or macOS users).

## Use of JSONPlaceholder API

The JSONPlaceholder API is a fake REST API used for testing purposes. It does not support modification operations such as POST, PUT, DELETE. Therefore, if you want to make full use of this app and actually create or delete a post, you will have to use or create a REST API that supports CRUD operations.

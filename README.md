# react-native-blog

A React Native blog app that uses Expo tools, which allows users to fetch content from JSONPlaceholder API.

## Prerequisites

First, install Expo, an open-source framework for apps that run natively on Android, iOS, and the web, on your device.

Then, to use Expo, you need to have the following tools installed on your machine:

- Node.js LTS release - Only Node.js LTS releases (even-numbered) are recommended.
- Git for source control.
- Watchman (for Linux or macOS users).

## Usage of JSONPlaceholder API

The JSONPlaceholder API is a fake REST API used for testing purposes. It does not support modification operations such as POST, PUT, DELETE. Therefore, if you want to create a new post or delete one, it will not actually do it. You have to create your own REST API that supports CRUD operations.
